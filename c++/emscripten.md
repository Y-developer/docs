# Emscripten

|Funtions|Desciption|
|-|-|
|emscripten_stack_get_base()|This method returns the base address of the stack memory. It provides the lowest address of the stack memory region used by the Wasm module.|
|emscripten_stack_get_current()|This method returns the current position of the stack pointer. It provides the current address of the stack pointer within the stack memory region.|
|emscripten_stack_get_end()|This method returns the end address of the stack memory region. It indicates the highest address available within the stack memory.|
|emscripten_stack_get_free()|This method returns the amount of free space available on the stack. It calculates the difference between the current stack pointer and the end address of the stack memory region.|
|emscripten_stack_init()|This method initializes the stack memory region for the Wasm module. It sets up the necessary data structures and prepares the stack memory for use.|
|fflush|The fflush function is typically used in C and C++ programs to flush the output buffer of a file. It ensures that any buffered data is written to the file immediately. In the context of WebAssembly, this function is typically used to synchronize output with the JavaScript environment.|
|memory|This is a global object that represents the linear memory associated with a WebAssembly module. The memory object provides an interface to read from and write to the linear memory. In Emscripten-generated code, you can access the linear memory using the memory object. For example, you can allocate memory, copy data to/from the linear memory, or perform other memory-related operations.|
|stackAlloc|This function is used to allocate memory on the stack. It is typically called from Emscripten-generated code to allocate temporary memory on the stack for local variables or function call frames. The stackAlloc function returns the allocated memory address.|
|stackRestore|The stackRestore function restores the stack to a previously saved state. It is used in conjunction with stackSave to manage stack memory. The stackRestore function takes a single argument, which is a value previously obtained from stackSave. It is typically used to restore the stack after a series of stack allocations (stackAlloc) have been performed.|
|stackSave|This function saves the current state of the stack. It is used to capture the current stack position, allowing subsequent allocations and modifications to be undone with stackRestore. The stackSave function returns a value representing the saved stack state.|
|__errno_location|This function is typically used in C and C++ programs to obtain a pointer to the current thread's errno variable. errno is an integer variable that stores error codes related to various library and system functions. By using __errno_location, you can access and modify the value of errno within your WebAssembly code.|
|__indirect_function_table| This is a global table object that serves as a function table in WebAssembly. It allows indirect calls to functions through their index in the table. The __indirect_function_table is used to provide dynamic function resolution and linking capabilities in WebAssembly programs. Functions can be added to this table, and their indices can be used to invoke those functions indirectly.|
|__wasm_call_ctors|This function is usually called during the initialization of a WebAssembly module. It is responsible for invoking constructors of static objects or performing any necessary initialization routines before the module starts executing. The __wasm_call_ctors function is commonly used in C++ programs to ensure that global or static objects are properly initialized before program execution.|
